# Feedback & Communication Style

The update from KUDA has my vote because it's more clearer than that of RISE Vest. And here are my reasons, I will start from the header down to the body of the message.

### The Heading

- KUDA went straight to the point by telling the users where they (the users) being are being affected, and that will catch the attention of whoever sees it to be interested in knowing why their Transfer may not be completed.

- RISE Vest used a big word and chances are that some of it's users may not take the time to read through the message and might still go ahead to transact with the platform, hence creating more work for the support team and may potentially lose some users to their competitors, just because the heading of the message wasn't clear and straight to the point.

### First Sentence

- KUDA went ahead to inform it's users on what's going on, i.e where the users themselves are being affected. And that's a great sign that they have their users in mind.

- RISE Vest unlike KUDA still continued with talking about themselves other than showing the users that they have their interest in mind. And again some users might see this as a red flag, and start thinking of opting to another service, making RISE loose a user which in turn affects revenue. 

### Similarities

- They both assured their users that the situation is under control, and they will be notified as soon as everything normalizes. 

## Improvements

-  KUDA communicated clearly but they didn't show 'EMPATHY' in their communication. So I think that's what's lacking in that message. And that's what I will improve on. So I will add these lines to their existing feedback message "We're sorry your transfers are being placed on hold at the moment. Please The settlement partner for all banks is fixing this now and we'll let you know as soon as it's done".
